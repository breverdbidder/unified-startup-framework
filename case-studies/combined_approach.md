# Combined Approach: Validation + Build

**Using both Enhanced Framework (validate) + Z.I.N.O.K (build)**

---

## Timeline: 0 to Launch in 10-16 Weeks

### Weeks 1-5: VALIDATE
**Framework:** Enhanced 40-Day  
**Goal:** Evidence-based GO/NO-GO  

- Week 1: Pre-validation (feasibility)
- Week 2: Deep research (competitors, ICP)
- Week 3: Smoke test (landing page)
- Week 4-5: Interviews (15-20 users)
- Week 5 end: Decision (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)

**Investment:** $500-1,000  
**Output:** Validated problem, committed beta users  

### Weeks 6-10: BUILD
**Framework:** Z.I.N.O.K  
**Goal:** Ship MVP to first users  

- Week 6: Pre-build (scope, tech stack)
- Week 7: Vibe-code (Loveable generates)
- Week 8: Beta launch (10 users)
- Week 9: Iterate (top requests)
- Week 10: Polish (payment prep)

**Investment:** $500-1,500  
**Output:** Working MVP, first customers  

### Weeks 11-16: ITERATE
**Framework:** Combined  
**Goal:** Product-market fit  

- Week 11-12: Monetize (launch paid)
- Week 13-14: Features (based on usage)
- Week 15-16: Scale prep (automate)

**Investment:** $1,000-3,000  
**Output:** $2-10K MRR, clear metrics

## Why This Works

**Validation prevents:**
- Building wrong thing (months wasted)
- No market need (42% of failures)
- Guessing features (analysis paralysis)

**Vibe-coding enables:**
- Fast shipping (weeks not months)
- Learning from real use (not plans)
- Iteration speed (daily not quarterly)

**Combined power:**
- Confidence from validation
- Speed from vibe-coding
- Metrics-driven iteration
- Sustainable growth

## Example: New SaaS Idea

**Problem:** Small agencies can't track project profitability  
**Idea:** Simple dashboard showing profit per project  

### Week 1-5: Validation

**Pre-validation:**
- Pain rating: 8/10 (agencies lose money on projects)
- Feasibility: 85/100 (technical + market timing good)
- Decision: GO

**Research:**
- Competitors: 5 complex tools ($100-500/mo)
- Blue Ocean: Simple, agency-specific
- ICP: 5-20 person agencies, service-based

**Smoke test:**
- Landing page: "Track project profit in real-time"
- Traffic: 600 visits (LinkedIn ads + content)
- Conversion: 4.2% (25 signups)
- Interviews: 18 completed

**Decision:** GREEN (all thresholds met)

### Week 6-10: Build

**Pre-build:**
- Must-have: Project tracking, time logs, profit calculation
- Tech: Loveable → Cursor → Vercel → Supabase
- Beta: 12 agencies committed

**Vibe-code:**
- Day 1: Loveable generates full dashboard
- Day 2-5: Cursor fixes bugs, improves UX
- Weekend: Deploy, invite beta users

**Beta:**
- Week 8: 12 agencies using daily
- Feedback: "Add client invoicing" (top request)
- Iteration: Ship invoicing in 2 days

**Week 10:**
- MVP complete at 75%
- 10/12 agencies using weekly
- Ready for payment

### Week 11-16: Monetize

**Launch paid:**
- Pricing: $49/mo per agency
- Conversion: 8/12 beta → paid (67%)
- New signups: 15/month
- MRR: $1,200 (Month 4)

**Iterate:**
- Add expense tracking (requested)
- Improve onboarding (40% → 70% activation)
- Client portal (differentiation)

**Month 4 results:**
- 25 paying customers
- $1,200 MRR  
- 15% MoM growth
- Clear path to $10K MRR

## Success Factors

**From validation:**
✅ Validated real problem (not assumption)  
✅ Confirmed willingness to pay  
✅ Beta users committed before building  
✅ Clear ICP and positioning  

**From vibe-coding:**
✅ Shipped in weeks (not months)  
✅ Learned from real usage  
✅ Iterated daily (not quarterly)  
✅ Built moat while shipping  

**Combined:**
✅ Low risk (validated first)  
✅ High speed (AI-powered)  
✅ Metrics-driven (track everything)  
✅ Sustainable (profitable path)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't skip validation because:**
- "I know my market" → Data says 42% build wrong thing
- "I'll iterate after launch" → Costs months of pivots
- "Validation slows me down" → Building wrong thing is slower

**Don't skip speed because:**
- "I'll perfect first" → Perfection takes 3-6× longer
- "Users expect polish" → They expect solutions, not polish
- "I'll launch when ready" → Ready never comes

**Do both:**
- Validate to reduce risk
- Build fast to learn quickly
- Iterate based on data
- Scale what works
