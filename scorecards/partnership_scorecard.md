## 🚩 Automatic Disqualifiers (Red Flags)

Even with high score, these are deal-breakers:

### Red Flags - Behavior
- [ ] **"Ideas person"** who won't execute ("I'll be the visionary, you build")
- [ ] **Wants 50/50 equity** but contributes 20% effort
- [ ] **No skin in the game** (time or money)
- [ ] **Different risk tolerance** (fundamental mismatch)
- [ ] **Unclear role boundaries** ("we'll figure it out later")
- [ ] **Poor communication** (disappears for days, vague responses)
- [ ] **Conflict avoidance** (agrees to everything, then doesn't deliver)
- [ ] **Credit-seeking** (takes credit for others' work)

### Red Flags - Capability
- [ ] **Never shipped** (chronic starter, never finisher)
- [ ] **Can't focus** (always chasing new ideas)
- [ ] **Ego-driven** (can't take feedback)
- [ ] **Inflexible** (my way or highway)
- [ ] **Avoids hard work** (only wants "fun" parts)

### Red Flags - Integrity
- [ ] **Lies or exaggerates** (track record, connections, capabilities)
- [ ] **Unethical behavior** (even in small things)
- [ ] **Speaks poorly** of past partners/employers
- [ ] **Blame others** (never their fault)
- [ ] **Commitmentphobe** (always keeps options open)

## ✅ Green Flags (Strongly Positive)

These increase confidence significantly:

**Track Record:**
- ✅ Successfully exited before (even small exit)
- ✅ Built to profitability without VC
- ✅ Strong references from past partners
- ✅ Domain expertise (10+ years in industry)
- ✅ Technical chops (can build themselves)

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Ships without being asked
- ✅ Takes feedback gracefully
- ✅ Admits mistakes quickly
- ✅ Gives credit generously
- ✅ Communicates proactively

**Alignment:**
- ✅ Already working together (trial period going well)
- ✅ Invested own money (has skin in game)
- ✅ Full-time commitment (all-in)
- ✅ Complementary not competitive (different strengths)
- ✅ Long-term thinking (not looking for quick flip)

**3+ green flags = Worth overlooking minor scoring gaps**

## 💰 Equity Split Framework

**Don't default to 50/50.** Base on contribution:

### Contribution Factors

**Idea (5-10%)**
- Original concept
- Market research
- Problem validation

**Execution (25-40%)**
- Who builds?
- Who sells?
- Who operates?

**Capital (15-30%)**
- Who funds?
- How much?
- When needed?

**Risk (10-20%)**
- Who quits job?
- Who has dependents?
- Who has runway?

**Domain Expertise (10-25%)**
- Industry connections
- Technical skills
- Unique advantage

### Example Splits

**Scenario 1: Technical + Business**
- You: 40% execution (build) + 10% capital + 15% risk = 65%
- Them: 30% execution (sales) + 5% idea = 35%

**Scenario 2: Equal Partners**
- You: 30% execution + 10% capital + 15% risk + 10% expertise = 65%
- Them: 35% execution + 5% capital + 5% idea + 5% expertise = 50%
- Adjust: 50/50 if truly equal

**Scenario 3: Late Joiner**
- You (6 months in): 50% (already built MVP, have customers)
- Them (joining now): 15-25% (bringing sales/scale expertise)
- Pool for future team: 25-35%

### Vesting Schedule

**Standard:** 4 years, 1-year cliff
- Earn 25% at 1 year
- Earn 1/48th monthly thereafter
- Leaves early? Keep only what vested

**Accelerated:** 3 years for fast-moving startups
**Cliff:** 6-12 months (test period)

**No vesting = huge mistake.** Always vest.

## 🎯 Trial Period Approach

**Don't commit immediately.** Run a trial:

**Month 1: Test Project**
- Small, defined scope
- Both contribute equally
- See how you work together
- No equity discussions yet

**Month 2: Evaluate**
- Communication: Easy or frustrating?
- Execution: Do they deliver?
- Chemistry: Enjoy working together?
- Values: Aligned on how to build?

**Month 3: Decision**
- Complete the scorecard
- Check for red/green flags
- Discuss equity openly
- Formalize or part ways

**Better to discover misfit in 3 months than 3 years.**

## 📊 Case Study: Good vs Bad Partnership

### ❌ Bad Partnership (Real Example)

**Setup:**
- Solo founder (technical)
- Brings on "business partner"
- 50/50 split, no vesting

**Red Flags Ignored:**
- Partner had no network (claimed to have it)
- Never made a sale (said "just need time")
- Part-time commitment (had other project)
- Equity without vesting (left at 8 months)

**Outcome:**
- Partner left, kept 50% equity
- Solo founder had to buy back or dilute
- 12 months wasted
- Nearly killed company

**Scorecard would have shown: 35/100 (RED FLAG)**

### ✅ Good Partnership (Real Example)

**Setup:**
- Solo founder (technical)
- Brings on sales lead from industry
- 60/40 split, 4-year vesting

**Green Flags:**
- Direct access to 50+ decision-makers
- Track record (sold similar product before)
- Full-time from day 1
- Invested $25K own money

**Outcome:**
- First customer in 2 weeks (from network)
- $500K ARR in 6 months
- Complementary skills (no overlap or conflict)
- Still together 3 years later

**Scorecard would have shown: 85/100 (STRONG YES)**

## 🔄 Annual Partnership Review

**Every 12 months, re-evaluate:**

**Contribution Check:**
- Who delivered what?
- Equal effort vs equity split?
- Adjust compensation if imbalanced?

**Alignment Check:**
- Still want same things?
- Same timeline?
- Same risk tolerance?

**Red Flag Check:**
- Any new concerns?
- Communication issues?
- Performance problems?

**Options:**
- Continue as-is (if aligned)
- Adjust roles (if capabilities changed)
- Buy out (if misaligned)
- Bring in new partner (if gaps)

**Startups change. Partnerships should adapt.**

## 💡 Final Thoughts on Partnerships

**Solo vs Partner Decision:**

**Go Solo If:**
- You're not desperate for skills
- You prefer full control
- You can wear multiple hats
- Revenue can cover hires

**Get Partner If:**
- Critical skills you lack
- Network you can't build fast
- Capital you don't have
- Execution speed 2× with partner

**The scorecard tells you if it's worth it.**

Score 80+ → Worth the complexity  
Score 50-79 → Consider contractors/hires instead  
Score <50 → Stay solo

**Remember:** Bad partner worse than no partner.

**Better alone and focused than partnered and fighting.** 🤝
