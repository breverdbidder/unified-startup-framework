## 🎯 When to Seek a Partner

### Seek Partner If:
- ✅ You lack critical skills (technical + non-technical founder)
- ✅ Workload is 60+ hours/week sustained
- ✅ Partner brings unfair advantage (unique network/expertise)
- ✅ You need capital injection (sweat equity trade)
- ✅ Mental health benefit (loneliness, burnout risk)

### Stay Solo If:
- ✅ You can execute alone (MVP in 4-6 weeks)
- ✅ Budget allows contractors ($5-10K)
- ✅ You're in validation phase (too early)
- ✅ No clear role boundaries yet
- ✅ You prefer full control (honest assessment)

**Rule of Thumb:** Partner up when 1+1 = 3 (synergy), not when 1+1 = 1.5 (dilution)

- **7-8:** Strong complement (e.g., both technical but different stacks)
- **4-6:** Some overlap (e.g., both non-technical)
- **1-3:** Complete overlap (e.g., both idea people)

Score: 10/10 ✅
```

## 🚩 Red Flags (Any = Reconsider)

### Deal-Breakers
- 🚩 **"Ideas Person"** - Won't execute, just suggests
- 🚩 **50/50 Equity for 20% Effort** - Wants unfair split
- 🚩 **No Skin in the Game** - No time or money invested
- 🚩 **Different Risk Tolerance** - You're all-in, they're dabbling
- 🚩 **Unclear Roles** - "We'll both do everything"
- 🚩 **Can't Take Feedback** - Defensive, argumentative
- 🚩 **"Trust Me" Mentality** - No transparency
- 🚩 **Lifestyle Business vs Unicorn** - Misaligned goals

### Warning Signs (2+ = Pause)
- ⚠️ Never asks questions (not curious)
- ⚠️ Talks more than listens (ego)
- ⚠️ Hasn't researched your market (lazy)
- ⚠️ Vague about past failures (hiding something)
- ⚠️ Name drops constantly (insecure)
- ⚠️ Wants role immediately (premature)

---

## ✅ Green Flags (3+ = Strong Candidate)

- ✅ **Track Record** - Built something 0→1 before
- ✅ **Unfair Advantage** - Unique access or skill
- ✅ **Self-Aware** - Knows strengths/weaknesses
- ✅ **Urgency** - Shares your timeline
- ✅ **Independent Validation** - Others vouch for them
- ✅ **Asks Great Questions** - Thoughtful, curious
- ✅ **Complements You** - Fills your gaps
- ✅ **Aligned Incentives** - Similar risk/reward goals
- ✅ **Transparent** - Honest about challenges
- ✅ **Cultural Match** - Similar work style

## 🤝 Equity Split Framework

**Don't default to 50/50 - it's often unfair.**

### Contribution-Based Model

**Allocate 100 points across:**
- **Idea (5%):** Who conceived it?
- **Execution (30%):** Who's building it?
- **Capital (25%):** Who's funding it?
- **Risk (20%):** Who has most to lose?
- **Expertise (20%):** Who has domain knowledge?

**Example Split:**

```
You: Idea (5) + Execution (20) + Capital (15) + Risk (15) + Expertise (15) = 70%
Them: Execution (10) + Capital (10) + Risk (5) + Expertise (5) = 30%
```

**Vesting Schedule:**
- **4 years total**
- **1-year cliff** (if they leave before Year 1, they get 0%)
- **25% at cliff**
- **Monthly vesting** after cliff (1/48 per month)

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents partner from leaving early with equity
- Incentivizes long-term commitment
- Fair to remaining founder if partner exits

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### 1. Partnering Too Early
**Problem:** You haven't validated yet  
**Solution:** Validate alone (Weeks 1-5), partner for Build (Weeks 6+)

### 2. Partnering with Friends
**Problem:** Can't give honest feedback  
**Solution:** Treat it like hiring (would you hire them?)

### 3. Vague Roles
**Problem:** Both doing everything poorly  
**Solution:** Clear domains, defined responsibilities

### 4. No Vesting
**Problem:** Partner leaves after 6 months with 50%  
**Solution:** 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff (always)

### 5. Skipping Legal
**Problem:** Disagreement with no framework  
**Solution:** $1-2K lawyer now saves $50K+ later
