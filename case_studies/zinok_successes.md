## Common Patterns Across All 5

### What Worked Every Time

1. **Personal Pain Point**
   - All 5 solved founder's own problem
   - Deep understanding of user pain
   - Authentic messaging

2. **Blue Ocean Thinking**
   - Not "better X" but "different angle on X"
   - Mettrico: Postman-specific (not general API)
   - TrekTrack: Social + AI (not just organizer)

3. **70/30 Shipping**
   - All shipped "incomplete" MVPs
   - User feedback drove features
   - Avoided feature bloat initially

4. **Vibe-Coding Speed**
   - 3-12 weeks to MVP (vs 6-12 months traditional)
   - AI-assisted development
   - Modern stack (React, Supabase, Vercel)

5. **Community-First Growth**
   - Started with engaged communities
   - Built in public
   - Word-of-mouth primary channel

### What Didn't Work (Common Mistakes)

1. **Underpriced Initially**
   - Mettrico: $9/mo → should have been $29/mo
   - TrekTrack: $4.99 → should have been $9.99
   - Lesson: B2B charge more, B2C test pricing

2. **Feature Bloat After Success**
   - All added too many features
   - Complexity hurt retention
   - Lesson: Say no to most feature requests

3. **Ignored Enterprise Too Long**
   - Sherlock AI finally cracked enterprise (Year 2)
   - 10× contract sizes vs SMB
   - Lesson: Enterprise ≠ scary if prepared

4. **Insufficient Customer Research**
   - All launched too fast (ironic!)
   - Could have validated more
   - Lesson: Even with 70/30, do Phase 0-4

5. **Solo Too Long**
   - All eventually needed partners
   - Waited 12-18 months
   - Lesson: Partner at $10-20K MRR
