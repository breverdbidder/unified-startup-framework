## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to be technical?**
A: No. Loveable generates code for you. Cursor helps you iterate. But basic understanding helps.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: Weeks 1-5 (validation): $500  
Weeks 6-10 (build): $50-500  
Month 4+ (scale): $1K-5K/month  

**Q: Can I do this solo?**
A: Yes. But consider partner at scale phase. Use scorecard to evaluate.

**Q: How long until first revenue?**
A: Typical: 12-16 weeks from start to first $1K MRR. Fast: 8-10 weeks. Slow: 20-24 weeks.

**Q: What if I get RED decision?**
A: Document learnings. Start over with new problem. This framework prevents wasted months.

**Q: Do I need all 3 phases?**
A: No. If already validated (like BidDeed: 10 years), skip to BUILD. If already building, skip to SCALE.

**Q: Can I modify this framework?**
A: Yes! It's open source (MIT license). Adapt to your needs. But follow core principles.
